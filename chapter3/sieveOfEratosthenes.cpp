/*
 * Sieve of Eratosthenes
 * The implementation has four loops.
 *  The goal is to set a[i] to 1 if i is Prime, else set a[i] to 0 if i is not Prime.
 *  In the first pass, all array elements are set to 1.
 *  In the second pass, all array indices that are known to be non Prime are set to 0 (multiples of Primes).
 *  If a[i] is 1 after all known multiples of smaller primes are set to 0, then we know it to be Prime.
 *
 * Complexity: N + N/2 + N/3 + N/5 + N/7 + N/11 + ...
 *  This is less than N + N/2 + N/3 + N/4 + N/5 + ... = NHn ~ N lg N
